## Future Plans

I plan to add sections for the services that I am going to provide with the technologies learned, also I plan to add a blog section where by I will document in an articles stuff that I learn and share with the world and if possible, I am going to add a subscriber section where visitors could learn some new stuff that may be shared in their email accounts.
